# DataStructures
Implementing data structures in C to understand them at a low level.

## Building / Testing
Each data structure directory will include a makefile that has targets for both Windows (using MinGW) and Linux. 

```bash
make windows
```
```bash
make linux
```

Since this is a learning exercise, only standard libraries will be used to reinforce low level understanding and should build out of the box as long as standard C libraries are present. 
main.c included with data structures for testing / using implementations. Headers are documented and should explain each function.
